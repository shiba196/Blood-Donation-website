<center><img src="http://nbtc.naco.gov.in/images/dp1.png">Drink plenty of fluids like water, soup and fruit juices to replace the volume lost during donation.<br>
<img src="http://nbtc.naco.gov.in/images/dp2.png">Avoid lifting heavy weights with the donation arm or engaging in strenuous physical activities to prevent complications.<br>
<img src="http://nbtc.naco.gov.in/images/dp3.png">If you feel dizzy, unwell or have cold sweats, follow the steps listed below.<br></center><br><br><br>
<ul><li>Take a seat or Iie down immediately, preferably with your feet raised, until the feeling passes. Loosen any restrictive garments and keep breathing smoothly.</li>
 <li>Keep calm and take slow and long deep breaths.</li>
 <li>Seek assistance from any passer-by or people near you.</li>
 <li>If the condition does not improve or for any reason something doesn't feel right, call the Blood Bank.</li>
 </ul>
In uncommon situations where fresh bleeding occurs after the plaster is removed, put gentle pressure on the venepuncture site, raise your arm for 3-5 minutes and apply a bandage to the site.<br><br>

The bandage or the dressing can be removed after 6 hours. If you notice bruising around the venepuncture site, it is usually caused by bleeding into the tissue underneath the skin.<br><br>

It will usually resolve in a week's time. If you feel pain or discomfort, applying a cold compress to the area may help. If the venepuncture site becomes swollen or blue or you experience pain or numbness in the arm, call the blood bank.<br>
